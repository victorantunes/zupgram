## A Time Traveller's hijacking of Instagram's fame and fortune

Welcome, wary time traveller! As you arrive from the year 2020, you'll realize you are now several year in the past.
 
But worry not! We have with ourselves the knowledge of how to build civilization from scratch! Well, sort of...

Will we use our skills to build a better world, you ask? *We most certainly will not!*

Here we strive to make one thing, and one thing only: fortune, money, *bufunfa*. And what better way to accomplish that than the tried and true idea hijacking?

That's right! We're gonna take something that's already big and established in the future and we're gonna steal its idea as if it were our own.
And then we're gonna sleep like babies next. N-O R-E-M-O-R-SE.

This time around we're gonna build one the future's big thing: **Instagram**.


### How to use
Just hit **make-dev** and the Neo4J database will be up ready. Next up, just build the project or import it into your favorite IDE and hit *Run* and voil√°!
It is ready to be critized and judged upon. But please be nice!
